1. A Fashion Object Classifying CNN model using Deep Learning.
   
2. I made this project in Jupyter Notebook. I have created a CNN model for classifying the fashion objects such as "T-Shirt/Top", "Trouser/Pant", "Pullover", "Dress", "Coat", "Sandal", "Shirt", "Sneaker", "Bag", "Ankle Boot" using fashion_mnist dataset.

3. The Sequentaial Model that I created contains a Flattern Layer, two Dense Layers with "relu" activation and "softmax" activation for Output Layer.

4. Finally, I trained the model with 30 epochs and got an accuracy of 91%.
